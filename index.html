<h2>UCBLibraryTimes</h2>

UCBLibraryTimes is a texting service that utilizes text messages to find current hours of the libraries in Berkeley. For example "doe" => "9 am-5 pm" or whatever the hours are for that day. This is set up using a trial version of Twilio that requires phone number verification and is thus not publicly useable.</br>

It is currently being ported to Google Voice and will hopefully be generally accessible soon!
