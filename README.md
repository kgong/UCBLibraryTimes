UCBLibraryTimes
===============

Text-based library hours information.

Getting Started
---------------

The phone number to text is (443)681-6416. This is currently set up using a trial account for Twilio, and requests are required in order to use this service. Contact me for any request. 

I'll be working on porting this to Google Voice in which it will be universally available.

Usage
-----

Text the name of the library to get that library's hours for the day. i.e. "doe", "mainstacks", "Engineering"

Alternatively, text "open" to get a list of currently open libraries.
